    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Brussels sprouts with bacon are roasted in a mixture of maple syrup and
      olive oil, resulting in a crispy, caramelized side dish that's quick and
      easy to make and perfect for weeknight dinners. The Brussels sprouts take
      on a nutty flavor during the roasting process, and the salty bacon is a
      delightful contrast with the sweet maple syrup â€” who knew Brussels sprouts
      with bacon could ever taste this good?
